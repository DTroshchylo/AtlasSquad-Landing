          <p>Atlas Squad Sàrl (“Company”, “We”, “Us” or “Our”) is a technology company providing executive coaching solutions. Our goal is to revolutionize the world of coaching through the combination of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and human advice. We provide users (“Users”) a platform of professional coaches (“Mentors”) aided by AI to help them improve their performance (the “Services”).</p>
          <p>A brief description of how Our Services work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users sign up for a mentoring program (the “Boot Camp”);</li>
            <li>after signing up, Users receive a message from one of our Mentors requiring carrying out the first Task;</li>
            <li>in order to complete the Boot Camp, Users need to carry out 25 different tasks involving different actions (such as preparing videos, recordings, writing essays etc.) to be put in place (the “Tasks”);</li>
            <li>aided by AI, Mentors will review each Task, provide feedbacks, assign a mark and new Tasks. Each mark allows Users to move forward until the completion of all Tasks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These terms of use (the “Terms”) apply to all Users and others who access and use our mobile app (the "App"),  and our website: www.atlas-squad.com (the “Website”). These are collectively referred to below as the "Platform."</p>

In return for enjoying Subscription-based access to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that the Company may generate revenues, increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of the Platform from your use of the Services, and you will have no right to share in any such revenue, goodwill or value whatsoever. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged.</p>
          <p>When you choose the Subscription-based access to the Services, you will be billed in advance (one-off) for the use of the Platform or on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly, or annually) for other services that you may purchase, depending on the type of plan you select when purchasing the Subscription. At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">3.2 Subscription Cancellations</h3>
          <p>You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your Account settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period and you will be able to access the Services until the end of your current subscription period.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">3.3 Billing</h3>
          <p>You shall provide the Company and or the third party provider that the Company might appoint to process payments with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, email address, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.

          <p>If you pay any fees with a credit card, then We may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">3.4 Fee Changes</h3>
          <p>The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. The Company will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Services after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">3.5 Refunds</h3>
          <p>Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable. Certain refund requests for subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.</p>

We reserve the right, however, to suspend or terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Atlas Squad’s own determination.</p>

          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>The Company will not be liable to you under any theory of liability — whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise — for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
          <p>The total liability of the Company for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to use the Platform. In no event will the Company’s total liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the use of or inability to use the Platform exceed the amounts you have paid to use the Platform's paid features. The exclusion and limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the Company and you.</p>
          <p>The limitations set forth in this Section will not limit or exclude liability for fraud or intentional misconduct of the Company for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">14. The AI ACT</h2>
          <p>On March 13, 2024 the European Parliament adopted the AI Act (the “Act”), which applies to any use of AI in the EU or where it will affect people in the EU. The overarching goal of the Act is to protect the health, safety, and fundamental rights of individuals as AI products enter the market. The Act aims to create a single framework for the creation, distribution, use and adoption of AI. It will replace existing national AI regulations, making it easier and legally safer for companies to operate across the EU. The Act will have a transition period of two years before full implementation. We are and will remain committed to meeting all future regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>The Act takes a risk-based approach, categorizing the use of AI as 'unacceptable risk', 'high risk', 'general purpose AI', 'limited risk' and 'minimal risk'. It is Our understanding that currently our platform should be considered 'minimal risk AI' as Our AI system poses little to no risk to fundamental rights or safety. In fact, Users do not dialogue nor directly interact with Our AI, but Our AI is used by Mentors to be assisted in analyzing Users feedback and enhance Mentor’s work. In particular, Users tasks will be analyzed by AI which might suggest Mentors appropriate new Tasks. It is then up to the Mentor to agree or red flag the AI suggestions. AI will also assist in understanding how to match Users among themselves for specific Tasks (“Buddying”).</p>
          <p>All data in the Atlas Squad's AI system can be deleted from within the system. Our system works completely without any Personal Information, for example by using full anonymization. For more information, please refer to Our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Our system does not conduct any biometric analysis and We are not interested in personal identification in the future. According to the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines "biometric data" as personal data obtained using special technical procedures relating to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person that enable or confirm the unique identification of a natural person, see Art. 4 No. 14 GDPR. Examples include facial images or dactyloscopic data (fingerprints).</p>
          <p>Our system does not recognize emotions and does not try to do so. The underlying AI does not understand whether the User is happy or sad, and does not try to understand it, because that would be irrelevant to the purpose of the AI support to the Boot Camp and to the Mentor. Only Mentors will be able to determine emotions, and adjust accordingly, but AI will not have any influence. Finally, as Our AI system does not understand the Users’ emotions, there is no attempt to influence or control them.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">15. Release</h2>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Company from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between the users and the acts or omissions of third parties.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">16. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute you have with any third party arising out of your use of the Services, including, by way of example and not limitation, any carrier or other user, is directly between you and such third party, and you irrevocably release the Atlas Squad parties and content providers from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>
          <p>All other disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms will be first resolved through contacting the Company by sending an e-mail to the following address: <a href="mailto:contact@atlas-squad.com">contact@atlas-squad.com</a> (subject: "Complaint"), or by letter sent to the registered office of Atlas Squad, indicated in Section 21. In case that the customer service complaint request is unsuccessful, the User may submit the dispute between him and the Company to a mediator who will try, in total independence and impartiality, to reconcile the parties to reach an amicable solution.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has also created an online platform for resolving disputes ("ODR platform") between businesses and consumers. The ODR platform can be accessed at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. Atlas Squad is free to decide whether to participate in a dispute resolution proceeding before the arbitration board of Geneva. It is also Atlas Squad’s faculty, if it takes part in a mediation procedure, to accept or reject what is proposed. In the absence of an amicable agreement, any dispute relating to the application of these general conditions of sale and their interpretation, their execution will be resolved in the courts of Geneva.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">17. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
          <p>These Terms will be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether Switzerland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the user's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.</p>
          <p>Any dispute between you and the Company that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the courts of Geneva.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">18. Right to Refuse Service</h2>
          <p>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to Atlas Squad's Platform without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may close, suspend or limit your access to Atlas Squad's Platform:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>if we determine that you have breached, or are acting in breach of these Terms;</li>
            <li>if we determine that you have infringed legal rights (resulting in actual or potential claims), including infringing intellectual property rights;</li>
            <li>if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;</li>
            <li>you do not respond to account verification requests;</li>
            <li>you do not complete account verification when requested;</li>
            <li>to manage any risk of loss to us, a user, or any other person; or for any other reasons.</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">19. Right to Refuse Service</h2>
          <p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms and update the “Effective date” above. In case we make substantial changes to the Terms (including the changes which might affect your rights), we will always notify you. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform after we provide the notice will imply your acceptance of those changes.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>
          <h2 class="-h6">20. Termination</h2>
          <p>We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to use the Platform. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to use the Platform. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Platform, all provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive, will survive, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability and dispute resolution provisions.</p>
          <span class="-hl"></span>

          <h2 class="-h6">22. Miscellaneous</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to Atlas Squad and your use of the Platform, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between the Company and you relating to Atlas Squad and your use of the Platform.</li>
            <li>The language of these Terms is the English language only.</li>
            <li>You hereby irrevocably waive any law applicable to you requiring that these Terms shall be localized to meet your language (as well as any other localization requirements) or requiring a delivery or retention of non-electronic records.</li>
            <li>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Company.</li>
            <li>Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</li>
            <li>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid and unenforceable (either by a mediator, ORD platform or arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the Dispute Resolution; above or by court of competent jurisdiction), that provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The Section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</li>
            <li>Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of you and the Company and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</li>
            <li>You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer your rights under these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may freely assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</li>
