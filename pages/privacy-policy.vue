          <h2 class="-h6">3. Information We collect</h2>
          <p>There are three basic categories of information We collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Information you provide to Us</li>
            <li>Information We collect automatically</li>
            <li>Information We obtain from third parties</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Information you provide to Us</h3>
          <p>When you use Our Services, you usually provide to Us certain information, including your Personal
            Information such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="-b">Identification information: </span>such as your name, email, address.</li>
            <li>If you contact Us, records, copies of your correspondence with Us and contact details that you have
              provided Us while making your inquiries (such as your name, postal addresses, email addresses and phone
              numbers or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline), in order to investigate
              your concerns, respond to your inquiries and to monitor and improve Our responses to your and other users’
              inquiries in relation to Our Services.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">When you use the Platform</h3>
          <p>When you visit Our Platform, We collect Internet or other electronic network activity information through
            the use of cookies and other trackers. Depending on your tracking preferences, the information We collect
            may include but is not limited to your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP’) address, referring website, what
            pages your device visited, and the time that your device visited our Platform. We may also rely on analytics
            and tools used to prevent spam and other security risks related to the use of abusive automated software.
            Visit our Cookie Policy for more information on the types of cookies and other trackers We use on our
            Platform.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Information We collect automatically</h3>
          <p>When you use Our Services, We may automatically collect certain data about you. This data is needed for
            operation of the Services and, among others, may be used for in-app analytics or marketing purposes. The
            data We collect automatically includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="-b">Device information: </span>information about your mobile device, or any other type of
              device you will be using in connection with the Services, and internet connection, including your IP
              address, the device’s unique device identifier, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Usage details: </span>details of your use of Our Services, including frequency of use,
              areas and features of the application that you access and engagement with particular features. This

              technologies to collect information, including saving cookies to users’ computers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Such automatically collected data helps Us operate our Services and improve it to deliver better service,

            Services and what you like and dislike the most.</p>
          <p>For further information please visit the Cookie Policy.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">The technologies We use for automatic data collection may include:</h3>
          <p>We use third-party analytics tools, such as AWS, LemList, Unbounce, Remarkety, Klaviyo to help Us measure
            traffic and usage trends for the Platform. These tools collect information via third-party analytics
            software development kits incorporated into the Platform, which may include your pseudonymized user ID and
            the information about the webpages you visit when following the links available to you on Our Services, your
            actions on the Platform and basic information about the type of subscription you have. We collect and use
            this analytics information in an aggregated manner with analytics information from other users so that it
            cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular user. For information on how third-party analytics
            tools collect and process your data, please contact us at <a
              href="mailto:privacy@atlas-squad.com">privacy@atlas-squad.com</a></p>

          <h2 class="-h6">4. Legal bases for using your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>According to Article 6 of the GDPR, We are allowed to use your Personal Information when certain conditions
            apply. These conditions are called “legal bases”, and We typically rely on one of four:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="-b">Consent (Article 6.1.a of the GDPR): </span>In some cases, We’ll ask for consent both
              for Personal Information to use your information for specific purposes. If We do, we’ll make sure you can
              revoke your consent in our Services or through your device permissions. Even if We’re not relying on
              consent to use your information, We may ask you for permission to access data like contacts and location.
            </li>
            <li><span class="-b">Contract (Article 6.1.b of the GDPR): </span>We might use your information because
              you’ve entered into an agreement with Us.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Legal obligation (Article 6.1.c of the GDPR): </span>We may be required to use your
              personal information to comply with the law, like when We respond to valid legal process or need to act to
              protect our users.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f of the GDPR): </span>We have—or a third party has—a
              legitimate interest in doing so. For example, We need to use your information to provide and improve Our
              Services, including protecting your account, providing customer support. An important point to understand
              about legitimate interest is that Our interests don’t outweigh your right to privacy, so We only rely on
              legitimate interest when We think the way we are using your data doesn’t significantly impact your privacy
              or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Personal Information We collect directly from you on our Platform</h3>
          <p>We will use Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To administer our Platform, and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis,
              testing, statistical and survey purposes.</li>

              your use of third-party apps and websites on your device to do this.</li>
            <li>For purposes made clear to you at the time you submit your Personal Information.</li>
            <li>As part of Our efforts to keep our Platform secure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our use of your Personal Information may be based on Our legitimate interests to ensure network,
            information security, and business performance improvement. Our direct marketing purposes are based on your
            consent. We may also rely on Our legitimate interests to improve business and marketing practices or contact

              Our responses to your and other users’ inquiries in relation to our Services. It is Our legitimate
              interest to provide you with high-quality support.</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to Our Services or any further product or service We offer or provide

          </p>

            such as contractors and service providers that We use to support our business who will act as data
            processors according to Article 28 of the GDPR. and who are bound by confidentiality and data protection

            ensuring that such third-party agent or Service Provider processes your Personal Information to the standard
            required by the applicable privacy laws, including the FADP, GDPR, and CCPA. These transfers will typically

            only secure places of storage.</p>
          <p><span class="-b">You are sharing your Personal Information. </span>You might be sharing information on

            users and the public.</p>
          <p><span class="-b">What happens in the event of a change of control. </span>If We sell or otherwise transfer
            part or the whole of the Company or Our assets to another organization (e.g., during a transaction like a
            merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your
            Personal Information and any other collected information may be among the items sold or transferred.</p>
          <p><span class="-b">Responding to legal requests and preventing harm. </span>We may access, preserve, and
            share your Personal Information in response to a legal (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena),
            government or regulatory request if We have a good faith belief that the law requires Us to do so. This may
            include responding to legal, government or regulatory requests from jurisdictions where We have a good faith
            belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is
            consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve, and share information
            when We have a good faith belief it is necessary to: (i) detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal
            activity; (ii) protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and (iii) prevent
            death or imminent bodily harm. Information We receive about you may be accessed, processed, and retained for

            or others.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Non-personal information</h3>
          <p>We may also share with third parties that provide services to Us or perform business purposes for us
            aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">6. Third-Party Advertisers</h2>
          <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may
            be of interest to you when you access and use the Services and other websites or online services, based on
            information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites or online services. To do
            so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
          <p>In addition, We may share information that do not directly identify you (such as de-identified usage data,
            referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help
            them understand the usage patterns for certain Atlas Squad services. Atlas Squad may allow third-party ad
            servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Services. These third-party ad servers or ad networks
            use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Platform.
            They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.</p>
          <p>They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the
            effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Atlas Squad does not
            provide any information that directly identifies you to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without
            your consent or as required under applicable law. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Atlas
            Squad to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser
            or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
          <p>In addition, third-party advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address,
            body information, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites to provide
            advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Atlas Squad is not the entity responsible for
            the processing of your information by third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Atlas Squad Privacy Policy
            does not apply to, and We cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the
            respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">7. International data transfer</h2>
          <p>Your Personal Information might be processed outside the EU. As to the location of our servers, they may be
            located, stored and/or processed in Switzerland or outside EEA/UK countries.</p>
          <p>When Service Providers engage in such transfers of Personal Information, they rely on i) Adequacy Decisions
            as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), or ii)
            Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. The European Commission has determined that
            the Standard Contractual Clauses provide sufficient safeguards to protect personal data transferred outside
            the EU or EEA. Furthermore, since Switzerland FADP is aligned with the GDPR, Switzerland can be recognized
            as a third country with an adequate level of data protection. Therefore, free data transfer between

          </p>
          <p>We will always protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy wherever it is processed.
            We do not voluntarily or actively transfer or disclose your Personal Information to the government or law
            enforcement authorities (the “Authorities”) and/or otherwise grant any Authorities access to your Personal
            Information.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">8. Treatment of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We will treat your Personal Information according to correctness, lawfulness and in compliance with all the
            principles of Article 5 of the GDPR, and with the aid of electronic tools, and in compliance with Article 5
            of this Policy.</p>
          <p>The analysis of your tastes and preferences which, subject to your previous consent, may be carried through
            profiling, will always involve a human intervention and will never take place exclusively in automated ways.
          </p>
          <p>We use appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative security measures to protect any Personal
            Information We store from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
          </p>
          <p>No company or service can guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
            failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user’s Personal Information at any time. Among
            other practices, your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent
            unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password
            appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have
            finished accessing your account.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">9. Data Retention</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="-b">Your Personal Information. </span>We store your Personal Information for different time
              periods depending on the category of Personal Information or you request us to delete your data (by
              contacting us at privacy@atlas-squad.com). Some information may be deleted automatically based on specific
              schedules, such as marketing information. Other information e.g., account information, may be retained for
              a longer period unless you request us to delete your data (by contacting us at privacy@atlas-squad.com).
              In particular, as soon as each User’s mentoring program has been completed or, in case of incompletion
              after 1 year of User inactivity, Atlas Squad notifies the User that all its program’s data (such as chats,
              videos, recordings and texts) will be removed completely from its systems. Finally, We may further retain
              information for business practices based on Our legitimate interests or legal purposes, such as network
              improvement, fraud prevention, record-keeping, or enforcing our legal rights.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Your Contents. </span>We keep your contents (such as chats, videos, recordings, and
              texts) on Our servers until the User’s program is concluded since they are necessary to give context and
              to allow Users and Mentors to perform the Tasks. However, as soon as each User’s program has been
              completed or, in case of incompletion after 1 year of User inactivity, Atlas Squad notifies the User that
              all its program’s data (such as chats, videos, recordings and texts) will be removed completely from its
              systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We inform you that, in case of revocation of your consent and, in any case, at the expiration of terms
            indicated above, We will erase or anonymize your Personal Information from Our archives.</p>
          <p>We may retain your Personal Information in connection with your privacy-related requests and communications
            with Us, if any, as necessary to comply with Our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce Our
            agreements. Even if We delete some or all of your Personal Information, We may continue to retain and use
            anonymized data previously collected that can no longer be used for personal identification.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">10. What are your rights (data subject rights -DSR)</h2>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">We want you to be in control of your Personal Information, so We provide you with the
            following tools:</h3>
          <p>You have the right to obtain from Us the indication of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the origin of the Personal Information;</li>
            <li>the purpose and method of processing the Personal Information;</li>
            <li>the logic applied in cases where processing is carried out with the aid of electronic instruments;</li>
            <li>the identification of the Data Controller, and Data Processors;</li>
            <li>the subjects or categories of subjects to whom the personal data may be communicated or who can learn
              about them as an appointed representative in the territory of the EEA or even in countries outside of the
              EEA where data is processed on our behalf.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In particular, you have the right to obtain:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the <span class="-b">access</span>, the <span class="-b">updating</span>, <span
                class="-b">rectification</span> or, when it is the case, the <span class="-b">integration</span> of your
              Personal Information;</li>
            <li>the <span class="-b">cancellation</span>, <span class="-b">transformation</span> into an anonymous
              format or <span class="-b">restriction</span> of data processing in case of a violation of the law, or
              when Personal Information retention is not necessary in relation to the purposes for which the Personal
              Information was collected or subsequently processed;</li>
            <li><span class="-b">certification/declaration</span> that the operations referred to in letters a) and b)
              above have been disclosed, also in reference to their content, of those to whom the data have been shared
              or disclosed, except in case where such fulfillment proves impossible or involves the use of means
              obviously disproportionate to the protected right.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Furthermore:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you have the right to <span class="-b">revoke</span> the consent without prejudice to the lawfulness of
              the processing carried out based on the consent already given;</li>
            <li>when applicable, you can also obtain a copy of your information in a <span class="-b">portable</span>
              format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want.</li>
            <li>you can change your preferences with regards to the cookies and other trackers at any time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Finally, you have the right to <span class="-b">object</span>, in whole or in part to the processing of
            your Personal Information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>for legitimate reasons, even when it is related to the purpose of the collection of your Personal
              Information;</li>
            <li>anytime Personal Information is processed for direct marketing purposes, including profiling, to the
              extent that such activity is connected to direct marketing:</li>
            <li>in case of automated decision making, if such a decision is based solely on automated processing and
              produces legal effects or significantly affects you.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because your privacy is important to Us, We will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional
            information before We let you access or update your personal information. We may also reject your request to
            access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request
            risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">11. How you can exercise your rights</h2>
          <p>If you would like exercise your rights referred to in Article 25 of the FADP (data subjects rights) or the
            rights referred to in Article 15 to 22 of the GDPR, or the California Consumer Privacy Act (‘CCPA’) or
            Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut you can send Us an email to privacy@atlas-squad.com. Our privacy
            team will examine your request and respond to you as quickly as possible and no longer than 30 days from the
            moment you exercise your right. Please note that We may still use any aggregated and de-identified Personal
            Information that does not identify any individual and may also retain and use your Personal Information as
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes. We do not charge a fee to process or
            respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If
            We determine that the request warrants a fee, We will tell you why We made that decision and provide you
            with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
          <p>We remind you that you have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority within EEA should you
            feel unsatisfied with Our treatment of your Personal Information.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">12. Specific geographies rights</h2>
          <p><span class="-b">Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut</span> may have
            statutory rights under state comprehensive privacy law including the rights specified below. You can
            exercise these rights by contacting Us at privacy@atlas-squad.com.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request the categories of Personal Information collected about you. </span>We
              will provide, where relevant and required by law, the types of data We collect.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request the categories of sources from which your Personal Information is
                collected. </span>We will provide, where relevant and required by law, the types of tools and
              organizations We use to collect data.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request the business or commercial purpose for collecting your Personal
                Information. </span>We will provide, where relevant and required by law, the purposes to collect data.
            </li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request the categories of third parties to whom Personal Information is
                disclosed, and the categories of Personal Information disclosed.</span> We will provide, where relevant
              and required by law, information regarding the other organizations that may receive your Personal
              Information.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request the specific pieces of Personal Information collected about
                you.</span> We will provide, where relevant and required by law, your Personal Information.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to request that Personal Information collected about you be deleted.</span> We
              may keep Personal Information for legal reasons but will accommodate deletion requests when required.
              Please be aware that erasing some Personal Information may affect your ability to use our Services.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Request that your inaccurate Personal Information be corrected.</span> If you believe
              your Personal Information is not correct you may provide Personal Information to replace the erroneous
              data.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Request that We do not sell or share your Personal Information.</span> Each state may
              interpret a “sale” of Personal Information differently, however, if you are a resident of the states above
              or Nevada and request that your Personal Information not be sold the Company will honor that request.
              Individuals in California may request their information not be shared with any third party.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">Right to non-discrimination.</span> The Company will not discriminate against you
              (e.g., through denying goods or services or providing a different level or quality of goods o/r services)
              for exercising any of the rights afforded to you.</li>
            <li><span class="-b">California and Delaware “Do Not Track” disclosures.</span> California and Delaware law
              require the Company to indicate whether it honors your browser’s “Do Not Track” settings concerning
              targeted advertising. The Company adheres to the standards set out in this Policy and does not monitor or
              respond to Do Not Track browser requests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please keep in mind that in case of a vague request to exercise any of the aforementioned right We may
            engage with you in a dialogue to ask for more details if so needed to complete your request. In case this is
            impossible, We reserve the right to refuse granting your request.</p>
          <p>Following the provisions of the applicable law, We might also ask you to prove your identity (for example,
            by requesting your user or some other proof of your identity) in order for you to invoke the mentioned
            rights. This is made to ensure that no right of third parties is violated by your request, and the mentioned
            rights are exercised by an actual Personal Information subject or an authorized person.</p>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Opting Out of Promotional Emails</h3>
          <p class="-note -b -up">IF REQUIRED BY LAW, WE WILL ASK FOR YOUR CONSENT TO SEND YOU PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING
            EMAILS. IF YOU WISH TO OPT-OUT OF OUR PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING EMAILS, YOU CAN OPT-OUT FROM OUR PROMOTIONAL
            AND MARKETING EMAIL LIST BY USING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS:</p>

            <li>by contacting Us at any time using the contact details above</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="-up -p -b">Users’ Age</h3>
          <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Atlas Squad does not knowingly collect or
            solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of eighteen (18) or knowingly allow such persons to
            register as Users. If you are under 18, please do not send any Information about yourself to Us. If We learn
            that We have collected Personal Information from someone under age 18 without parental consent, We will
            delete that Information as quickly as possible. If you believe someone under 18 has submitted Personal
            Information to us without your consent, please contact us at <a
              href="mailto:privacy@atlas-squad.com">privacy@atlas-squad.com</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">13. Linked websites</h2>
          <p>For your convenience, hyperlinks may be posted on the Services that links to other websites (the “Linked
            Sites”). We are not responsible for, and this Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of any Linked
            Sites or of any companies that We do not own or control. Linked Sites may collect information in addition to
            that which We collect through Our services. We do not endorse any of these Linked Sites, the services or
            products described or offered on such Linked Sites, or any of the content contained on the Linked Sites. We
            encourage you to seek out and read each Linked Site’s privacy notice to understand how the Personal
            Information about you is used and protected.</p>

          <h2 class="-h6">14. Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>The date this Policy was last revised is indicated at the top of the page. The Company may modify or update
            this Policy from time to time. Some changes do not require your consent: for example, when We add a new
            purpose of processing that is compatible with the existing purposes, or the new processing activity that
            falls under the users’ reasonable expectation. However, if the changes made may pose risk to your rights and
            freedoms (e.g., by including a new purpose of the processing that is not compatible with the existing
            purposes of processing, a new legal basis, a new category of personal data to be collected or a new data
            subject, all of which are not reasonably expected by the users, we will ask for your consent to those
            changes separately from this Policy. If you did not receive a request for your consent to the changes or
            refused to give consent, those changes will not apply to you. That fact can negatively affect some of our
            Services provided to you in case those services inevitably include consent to the changes.</p>
